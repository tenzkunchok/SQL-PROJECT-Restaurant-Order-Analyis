# SQL-PROJECT-Restaurant-Order-Analyis
This project analyzes restaurant order data to uncover insights about menu performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. The analysis was conducted using SQL to explore two main tables: menu_items and orders_details.

# Objectives

#1. Explore the `menu_items` table
- Determine the number of menu items
- Identify the **least** and **most expensive** items
- Analyze item prices by category (e.g., Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts)

# 2. Explore the `order_details` table
- Identify the range of order dates
- Count how many items were included in each order
- Find the orders with the **highest number of items**

# 3. Analyze customer behavior
- Combine the `menu_items` and `order_details` tables
- Determine the **least** and **most ordered** categories
- Explore the **highest spend** orders  
  â†’ **Order ID 440** was identified as the **most expensive order**
